# Parallel Routes

Parallel Routes allows you to render multiple Nuxt pages within a single route, either synchronously or manually.

For example, within a single layout, in addition to the standard `<slot>` that renders the content based on the global router, you can render two parallel routes named `left` and `right` synchronously.

::code-group
```html [layouts/default.vue]
<div>
    <PlusParallelPage name="left" />
    <slot />
    <PlusParallelPage name="right" />
</div>
```

## Usage

::alert{type="info"}
Before we start, make sure you have installed `nuxt-pages-plus` module in your Nuxt project.
::

For instance, here's how your original Nuxt project setup with one route: `/` and `/about` and a default layout looks like:

::code-group
```html [pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Index</h1>
    <NuxtLink to="/about">Go About</NuxtLink>
  </div>
</template>
```

```html [pages/about.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>About</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

```html [layouts/default.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```
::

### Adding Parallel Routes

In this tutorial, we will create a simple parallel route named `my-parallel` that displays a parallel route view on the layout.

First, create a new folder named `@my-parallel` in the `~/pages` directory.

Then, create two new files named `index.vue` and `about.vue` inside the `@my-parallel` directory.

::code-group
```html [pages/@my-parallel/index.vue]
<template>
  <div>Index @my-parallel</div>
</template>
```

```html [pages/@my-parallel/about.vue]
<template>
  <div>About @my-parallel</div>
</template>
```
::

::alert{type="info"}
For more information about file naming for file-based routing in Nuxt Pages Plus, please refer to the [Directory Structure](/getting-started/directory-structure).
::

### Displaying Parallel Routes

`<PlusParallelPage>` is used for rendering the parallel routes. We recommend placing it in the layout file but actually you can place it in any page based on your needs.

::code-group
```html [layouts/default.vue]{3}
<template>
  <div>
    <PlusParallelPage name="my-parallel" />
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```
::

Now, when you navigate to the `/` route, you will see the `@my-parallel/index.vue` view is rendered.

::code-group
```html [http://localhost/]{4}
<html>
  <div>
    <!-- pages/@my-parallel/index.vue -->
    <div>Index @my-parallel</div>

    <!-- pages/index.vue -->
    <div>
      <h1>Index</h1>
      <NuxtLink to="/about">Go About</NuxtLink>
    </div>
  </div>
</html>
```
::

If you navigate to the `/about` route, you will see the `@my-parallel/about.vue` view is rendered.

::code-group
```html [http://localhost/about]{4}
<html>
  <div>
    <!-- pages/@my-parallel/about.vue -->
    <div>About @my-parallel</div>

    <!-- pages/about.vue -->
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</html>
```
::

## How it works?

Nuxt Pages Plus enhances the routing system in Nuxt by identifying paths designated as parallel routes, which are grouped into independent routers that can automatically sync with the global router. This setup includes a robust and controllable [Fallback Mechanism](#fallback-mechanism) to handle missing routes gracefully.

Users can dynamically integrate these routers into different layers or pages of their application using the [`<PlusParallelPage />`](/components/plus-parallel-page) component, allowing for flexible and modular application architecture. This process streamlines the management of complex routing scenarios, enhancing both development efficiency and application scalability.

## Navigation Behavior

Parallel Routes will auto sync their routes with the global route by default. It is also compatible with all of Nuxt's Pages naming pattern including `[id]` ([dynamic routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages#dynamic-routes)), `[...slug]`([catch-all route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages#catch-all-route)), etc.

### Fallback Mechanism

In scenarios where Parallel Routes synchronize with the global route but fail to find a matching route, Nuxt Pages Plus employs a series of fallback mechanisms to handle these cases gracefully.

::code-group
```html [layouts/default.vue]{4-6}
<template>
  <div>
    <PlusParallelPage name="left">
      <template #not-found>
        <div>Not Found</div>
      </template>
    <PlusParallelPage />
  </div>
</template>
```
::

Hereâ€™s the fallback sequence of operations that occurs during navigation:

**On initial page load:**

1. Navigate if the current URL matches any routes in `~/pages`.
2. Otherwise, try redirecting to [`fallback.redirect`](/getting-started/configuration#fallback) if it has been set in config.
4. Otherwise, try rendering the `#not-found` slot if it has been set in [`PlusParallelPage`](/components/plus-parallel-page).
3. Otherwise, try redirecting to `/~index` (or [`index`](/getting-started/configuration#index) set in config) if it can be resolved.
5. Otherwise, try rendering the `#index` slot if it has been set in [`PlusParallelPage`](/components/plus-parallel-page).
6. If none of the above conditions are met, leave the view empty.

**On route navigate:**

1. Navigate if the target URL matches any routes in `~/pages`.
2. Otherwise, try redirecting to [`fallback.redirect`](/getting-started/configuration#fallback) if it has been set in the config.
3. Otherwise, try rendering the `#not-found` slot if it has been set in [`PlusParallelPage`](/components/plus-parallel-page).
4. If none of the above conditions are met, keep the last successful view.

::alert{type="info"}
Please note that all fallback redirects occur exclusively within the Parallel Router and do not affect the global router or change the browser's URL.
::

#### Disabling the Fallback Mechanism

You have the option to disable the fallback mechanism for specific parallel routes. This can be useful if you want the parallel route view to become empty when no matching routes are found, rather than attempting any fallback redirects.

In addition to disabling parallel route, you might also consider enabling [`hide-fallback`](/components/plus-parallel-page#hide-view-on-fallback) to hide your fallback view in individual `<PlusParallelPage>` components.

::code-group
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]{5}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  pagesPlus: {
    parallelPages: {
      left: { // your parallel routes name
        fallback: false
      }
    }
  }
})
```
::

### Sync Modes

To customize the synchronization behavior of Parallel Routes with the global route in your Nuxt application, you can modify the synchronization mode for specific parallel routes.

::code-group
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]{5}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  pagesPlus: {
    parallelPages: {
      left: { // your parallel routes name
        mode: 'manual'
      }
    }
  }
})
```
::

| Mode        | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `sync`      | (Default) Auto sync with global route. |
| `sync-once` | Only sync once on initial page load.   |
| `manual`    | Disable auto sync with global route.   |
